This application is build on vite+react "User Dashboard". In this application i am using mock api called "dummyjson" api link is "https://dummyjson.com/" this is mock api integrated with context api for local state management, getting user list from the api and showing data on the table then on user name click it will open the user detail where you can edit the details of the user and can delete the user as well. In this project the libaray for UI is ant design which the popular for react. Last there is search bar in user list which is integrated with search api.
